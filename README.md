PgBarcodeScanner
================

Full implementation of a phonegap barcode scanner for the platforms supported by com.phonegap.plugins.barcodescanner.

It has some interesting features like using using the $q promise/deferred implementation to capture the barcode scanner information for display in a table and the angularjs state routing that is the default in the ionic framework.

To use it in phonegap, create a new, open-source project and provide this github repository. Phonegap knows how to deal with the www directory tree automatically.

It has not been fully tested so please beware. It is only meant to show the basic ideas so that you can easily incorporate the barcode scanner into your app.
